  Text: 'To be honest, I thought the project would be over couple of years ago...
    I thought it would last only a couple of months, maybe a year...

    But, here
    we are, two and a half years later, I am still scribbling notes and making changes
    to the code.

    I hope whoever finds this, will be reading the notes already
    when I''ll either be gone or will be working on something new and exciting.

    Until
    next time, Dr. Al Pacaman'
